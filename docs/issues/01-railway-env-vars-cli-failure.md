# Issue #01: Railway CLI fails to set environment variables

## Status

## Description
The Railway setup script fails to set environment variables using the Railway CLI commands. The script attempts to set variables individually using `railway variables set`, but all attempts fail.

## Error Output
```
[INFO] Setting Railway environment variables...
[INFO] Setting: NODE_ENV=production
[WARNING] Failed to set NODE_ENV=production
[INFO] Setting: RAILPACK_PACKAGES=nodejs@22.13.0
[WARNING] Failed to set RAILPACK_PACKAGES=nodejs@22.13.0
[INFO] Setting: NO_CACHE=1
[WARNING] Failed to set NO_CACHE=1
[SUCCESS] Environment variables configured
```

## Root Cause
The Railway CLI `railway variables set` command may have limitations or require different syntax. Individual variable setting via CLI is unreliable.

## Solution
Use `.env` file approach instead of CLI commands:
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Railway automatically reads `.env` files during deployment
3. This is more reliable and aligns with Railway's recommended practices

## Implementation
The script has been updated to:
- Create a `.env` file with required variables
- Railway reads this file automatically during deployment
- Removed individual `railway variables set` commands

- `scripts/railway-setup.sh`
- `.env` (created during setup)
